## Part B

### Objective
Maximize expected number of points awarded based off a team's win probability.

### Decision Variables
$$
x_{ik} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if team i wins round k},\\ 
0 & \text{o/w} \end{cases}\\
$$  
$$
p_{ik}= \text{probability that team i wins round k }\\
\forall i\in{[0,63]},\ k\in[0, 5]
$$

## Objective Function
$$
\text{max}\sum_{k = 0}^{5}(2^k\sum^{63}_{i=0}p_{ik}x_{ik})\ 
$$  

### Constraints
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=n}^5x_{ik} \le (6-n)x_{i,n-1}\ \ &\forall\ i\in[0,63], n\in[1,5]\ \ \ \ \ \text{cannot win future rounds if loss in previous round} \\
\sum_{a=0}^1x_{2p+a,0}=1 \ \ \ \ &\forall p \in [0,31] \ \ \ \ \  \text{winners for Round of 64} \\
\sum_{a=0}^3x_{4p+a,1}=1 \ \ \ \ &\forall p \in[0,15] \ \ \ \ \ \text{winners for Round of 32} \\
\sum_{a=0}^7x_{8p+a,2}=1 \ \ \ \ &\forall p \in[0,7] \ \ \ \ \ \text{winners for Sweet Sixteen} \\
\sum_{a=0}^{15}x_{16p+a,3}=1 \ \ \ \ &\forall p \in[0,3] \ \ \ \ \ \text{winners for Elite Eight} \\
\sum_{a=0}^{31}x_{32p+a,4}=1 \ \ \ \ &\forall p \in[0,1] \ \ \ \ \ \text{winners for Final Four} \\
\sum_{i=0}^{63}x_{i,5}=1 \ \ \ \ &\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \text{winners for Championship Game} \\
\end{aligned}

## Part C

See: "PartC.py"

![Optimal Solution Bracket](4133ProjectOutput.jpeg)

Objective Value: 97.337068321

\newpage

## Part D

We would have scored **78 points**, when comparing our optimal solution to the 2019 bracket.

## Part E

$$
\sum_{i,k}x_{i,k} \le 62 \text{   with }x_{ik}\text{ as the previous iteration's decision variables equal to 1} 
$$



## Part F

See "PartF.py"

![2nd Best Optimal Solution Bracket](4133ProjectOutput2.jpeg)
In this bracket, Iowa wins in the first round, instead of Cincinatti.

The new bracket has an Objective Value of 97.326068321 and a 2019 comparison score of 79.

\newpage

## Part G

See "PartG.py"

![10 Best Optimal Solutions](10bracketspart)

We can see here that there are only minute differences in the brackets. It is usually the result of changing the outcome of a game in the Round of 64 that does not impact any of the big future games that score the most points for our objective. Even after changing our optimal solution 10 times, we only dropped .053 points off the objective value, indicating that there are a lot of games that can be changed and hardly affect the outcome.

\newpage

## Part H

See "PartH.py"

To diversify our brackets and increase the chance of having a bracket with a higher actual score, we employed two methods. 

The first one focused on generating upsets. Upsets are very common in the first round, as a lower seed can sometimes shock a higher seed and win a game they weren't supposed to. We found some data describing the probability of upsets occurring, with a 50.7% chance for 9 vs. 8, 39.6% for 10 vs. 7, 37.5% for 11 vs. 6, and 35.4% for 12 vs. 5.Based off this information, we created 3 new constraints that guarantee that at least one 12 seed, 11 seed, and 10 seed upset their higher ranked opponents and also a constraint that guarantees at least two upset for the 9th seeds. This improved the average score of our bracket, with most of the brackets now reaching scores of 81 and one hitting 82.

The second method also used historical data to create constraints. First seeds generally do well, but they aren't guaranteed to make it to the championship. For example, there has only been one instance of all Final Four team seeds being a 1 seed. To account for this, we added a constraint stating that at most 3 1-seed teams can make the Final Four. This greatly improved the average scores of our brackets to around 87 with a high of 88. This constraint had great success in predicting brackets that were closer to the 2019 bracket. 

![10 Best Optimal Solutions with the upset and 1 seed constraints](Ad-Hoc Constraint 2)

Added Upset and 1 seed constraints:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{5,\ 0} + x_{21,\ 0} + x_{37,\ 0} + x_{53,\ 0} &\ge 1 \ \ \ \ \  \text{guarantees an upset in first round between a 5 and 12 seed} \\
x_{9,\ 0} + x_{25,\ 0} + x_{41,\ 0} + x_{57,\ 0} &\ge 1 \ \ \ \ \  \text{guarantees an upset in first round between a 6 and 11 seed} \\ 
x_{13,\ 0} + x_{29,\ 0} + x_{45,\ 0} + x_{61,\ 0} &\ge 1 \ \ \ \ \  \text{guarantees an upset in first round between a 7 and 10 seed} \\ 
x_{3,\ 0} + x_{19,\ 0} + x_{35,\ 0} + x_{51,\ 0} &\ge 2 \ \ \ \ \  \text{guarantees two upsets in first round between a 8 and 9 seed} \\
x_{0,3}+x_{15,3}+x_{31,3}+x_{47,3} &\le 3 \ \ \ \ \  \text{guarantees that at most 3 1-seed teams make the Final Four} \\
\end{aligned}
